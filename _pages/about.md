I am currently a third-year master's student at the Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG) in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor Bin Xu. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at Xinya College at Tsinghua University, where I received not only a solid fundation in computer science but also a comprehensive liberal arts education. I am currently in the process of applying for Ph.D. programs for Fall 2025, with the focus described below:

Research
======

My research aims to integrate foundation models to address key challenges in systems, with a particular focus on cross-disciplinary or interdisciplinary applications.

Beyond the Research
======

Curiosity
------

In my spare time, I actively explore emerging areas like Web3 from the perspective of computer science to foster my skills and push my boundary of knowledge.

Service
------

*"I'm so lucky to have such a patient TA!!! — A student from the Programming Training 2023"*

Despite the demands of my master's study, I make sure to give back to the community. I'm proud to join the [Coding Girls x Hello World](https://codinggirls.cn/en/) project to promote equality in the tech industry.

Enthusiasm
------
To keep it short, I excel at soccer and singing, and actively taking on leadership roles within my activities. Last year, I led my team to win the Zhipu Cup 2023 as captain and received the FMVP award.
