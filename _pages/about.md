I am currently a third-year master's student at the [Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG)](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of [Professor Bin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eV_MEVYAAAAJ). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Xinya College](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University, where I received not only a solid fundation in computer science but also a comprehensive liberal arts education.

I am currently in the process of applying for Ph.D. programs for Fall 2025, with the focus described below:

Research
------
My research aims to integrate foundation models to address key challenges in systems, with a particular focus on cross-disciplinary or interdisciplinary applications.

- [MAIC](https://project.maic.chat/): A platform for interactive online classrooms powered by multiple LLM agents

### Patents
- A pending patent concerning data processing with LLM in interview system, which is provisionally approved.

Beyond the Research
------

### Curiosity
In my spare time, I actively explore emerging areas like Web3 from the perspective of computer science to foster my skills and push my boundary of knowledge.

### Service
*"I'm so lucky to have such a patient TA!!! â€” A student from the Programming Training 2023"*

Despite the demands of my master's study, I make sure to give back to the community. I'm proud to join the [Coding Girls x Hello World](https://codinggirls.cn/en/) project to promote equality in the tech industry.

### Enthusiasm
To keep it short, I excel at soccer and singing, and actively take on leadership roles within my activities. Last year, I led my team to win the Zhipu Cup 2023 as captain and received the FMVP award.
